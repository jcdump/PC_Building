                    Before starting to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer">desktop pc</a>, it is good to have a case in mind, if not a case, a case size.Your case size will determine what components can fit in your build and what cannot. The best PC size for you will depend on your needs, budget, and  preferences. Take time to research and compare different options before making a decision.

                    Motherboards serve as the backbone of a computer system, providing connectivity and compatibility for various components such as the CPU, memory, storage devices, graphics cards, and peripherals. Choosing the right motherboard is crucial for building a stable and high-performance desktop PC. Motherboards come in different form factors, including ATX, Micro-ATX (mATX), and Mini-ITX. The form factor determines the physical size of the motherboard and its compatibility with different PC cases. When choosing a desktop motherboard, consider factors such as form factor, CPU socket compatibility, chipset features, memory support, expansion slots, storage connectivity, I/O ports, networking and audio capabilities, build quality, price, and budget. Researching reviews, comparisons, and user feedback can help you find the best motherboard for your specific PC build and requirements.

                    The CPU socket determines the type of processor that can be installed on the motherboard. Common CPU sockets for desktop motherboards include Intel's LGA (Land Grid Array) sockets, such as LGA 1200 for 10th and 11th generation Intel Core processors, LGA 1700 for 12th to 14th generation Intel Core processors, AMD's AM4 socket for Ryzen  Zen+, Zen 2 and Zen 3 processors, and AMD’s AM5 socket for Ryzen Zen 4(+) processors. Ensure compatibility between the motherboard's CPU socket and your CPU.

                    Processors, also known as CPUs (Central Processing Units), are the primary component responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations in a computer. Choosing the right desktop processor is crucial for achieving optimal performance in various tasks, including gaming, content creation, productivity, and everyday computing. The two main CPU manufacturers for desktop processors are Intel and AMD. Both offer a range of processors targeting different performance levels and price points. It is best to do some research to find what price:performance point suits your requirements and budget in the current market. Performance, price, core count, threads, socket compatibility, integrated graphics, use case, and future upgrade-ability are all things to consider when choosing a CPU.

The two primary GPU manufacturers for desktop graphics cards are NVIDIA and AMD. Both NVIDIA and AMD offer a range of GPUs with varying performance levels, features, and price points. When choosing between them, consider your performance needs, budget, game compatibility, future-proofing, compatibility with other components, and specific use cases such as gaming, content creation, or professional workloads. Researching benchmarks, reviews, and comparisons can help you make an informed decision based on your preferences and requirements.

                Memory, also known as RAM (Random Access Memory), is a crucial component of a computer system that temporarily stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to access quickly. Choosing the right memory modules is essential for ensuring smooth multitasking, fast application loading times, and overall system performance. The most common type of desktop memory is DDR (Double Data Rate) SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory). DDR5 is the latest iteration of DDR memory, succeeding DDR4. It brings several enhancements over DDR4, including higher data transfer rates, improved power efficiency, and increased capacity potential. Most systems will use either DDR4 or DDR5, although some older systems may still use DDR3. When choosing between DDR4 and DDR5 memory, consider your performance requirements, budget, motherboard compatibility, future-proofing needs, usage scenario, CPU compatibility, and price-performance ratio. DDR4 is a solid choice for most users with standard computing needs, while DDR5 offers cutting-edge performance for enthusiasts, gamers, content creators, and professionals who demand the best performance from their system

                Power supplies, often referred to as PSUs (Power Supply Units), are critical components responsible for converting AC (alternating current) power from the wall outlet into DC (direct current) power required by the computer's components. Choosing the right power supply is essential for providing stable and reliable power to your system while ensuring compatibility with your components and allowing for future upgrades. When choosing a desktop power supply, consider factors such as wattage, efficiency rating, modularity, connectors and cable lengths, form factor, quality and reliability, cooling and noise levels, price, and budget. Researching reviews, comparisons, and user feedback can help you find the best power supply for your specific system configuration and requirements

                Desktop storage refers to the various types of storage devices used in desktop computers to store data, applications, and operating systems. Common types of desktop storage include hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and optical drives (such as CD/DVD drives). When choosing desktop storage devices, consider factors such as performance, capacity, reliability, budget, usage scenario, and future upgradability. SSDs offer superior performance and faster data access speeds compared to HDDs, while HDDs provide higher capacities at lower costs. Assess your specific requirements and prioritize features based on your needs and budget constraints.
